#Hugepages configuration


>>>Applications using hugepages can benefit from these larger page sizes because they have a greater chance of finding memory mapping info
in cache and thereby avoid more expensive operations.

By using a larger page size, a single TLB entry can represent a larger memory range.  As mentioned before, the default page size in Linux is 4 KB. 
A large page in Linux is 2 MB. 
So a large page can cover the same memory range as 512 4 KB pages. As a result, there will be less pressure on the TLB and memory-intensive 
applications may have better  performance due to an increased TLB hit ratio.

>>>Using huge pages means the processorâ€™s MMU (memory management unit) spends less time walking page tables to refill the TLB. Using hugepages also
reduces the amount of memory used for storing the page tables
and it reduces the operating system maintenance of page states.
Hugepages must be enabled for running DPDK with high performance.

**To display current huge page settings**
dpdk-hugepages.py -s

**To a complete setup of with 2 Gigabyte of 1G huge pages:**
dpdk-hugepages.py -p 1G --setup 2G


**Command to allocate hugepages:**

echo 1024 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages


In some applications, 1024 may not be enough , then it will show an error regarding memory shortage , you can then allocate 2048 instead of 1024
