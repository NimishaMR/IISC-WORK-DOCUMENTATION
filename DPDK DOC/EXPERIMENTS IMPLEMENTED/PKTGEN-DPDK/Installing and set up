First setup pktgen application:

Follow these steps for it:
1)git clone git://dpdk.org/apps/pktgen-dpdk
2)cd pktgen-dpdk
4)cd cfg
5)sudo nano default.cfg
(here few things have to be removed and changed):
a)in "devices" : Remove the other random devices and instead add the names of your nic's devices"
b)in cores: remove the list of cores your cpu doesnt have
c)completely remove blocklist and allowlist
then go back to pktgen directory:
6)cd pktgen-dpdk
7)make


There are two ways to generate packets:
Run a lua script or type pacet features in the command line:
To run commmad line go to :
cd Buiddir/app 
Here you can execute your pktgen command using EAL Parameters

**NOTE: BEFORE RUNNING ANY PKTGEN APPLICATION MAKE SURE THAT HUGE PAGES ARE SET UP , THE NIC WHO'S PORT IS SENDING THE PACKET IS BOUND TO ANY DPDK-BASED 
DRIVERS "



THere are two scripts in the experiments implemented folder called "install-dpdk-pktgen.sh" and "dpdk-install-joy.sh"
These two scripts an be run as root to overall install dpdk and pktgen together and also set up all hugepages and bind the ports to DPDK
