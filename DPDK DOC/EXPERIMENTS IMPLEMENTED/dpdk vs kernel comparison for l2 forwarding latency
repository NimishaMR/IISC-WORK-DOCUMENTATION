Comparison of DPDK RXTX CALLBACKS example performance with kernel  L2 forwarding experiment:

1)BOth are using the same packet generator with same parameters:
Use pktgen as mentioned in the packetgen instruction file:
set the following parametrs:
set 0 count 50000
set 0 proto udp
set 0 rate 0.01


NOw the average cycles in DPDK Was 39 cycles:
Hence the average forwarding latency for 50000 packets is:
15.6 ns

IN kernel:
If the bridging script is run in the system and wireshark captures are taken and compared each packet wise between the two ports of nic :
then if the epoch time's are subtracted :

The latencies progress as follows:
1)Latency 1- 136938 ns
2)Latency 2: 213806 ns
3)Latency 3: 493365951.4ns
