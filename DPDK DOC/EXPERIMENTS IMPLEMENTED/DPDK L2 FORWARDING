FIRST RUN A BASIC SKELETON EXAMPLE

1)Forwards from one port to another just to verify if the ports are bounded to dpdk propely)
2)cd build
3)cd exampels
4)./dpdk-skeleton -l 1 -n 4

an error may come as Cause: Error: number of ports must be even
This is because only  eth1 (one port) has been bound to dpdk:
So bind the another port (eth2) as well to the same uio driver like how we did for port 1
