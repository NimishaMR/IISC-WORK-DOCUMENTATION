This is the documentation for the work pertaining to the Intel Data Plane Development Kit that I have worked on at Zenlab , IISc.

It conatins information about what DPDK is , it's advantages and drawbacks , it's architecturual composition and it's scope of application.

To set up DPDK on your Ubuntu machine , you need to keep in mind some dependensies and do some installations.All the modules to be installed are provided as 'shell' commands in the Installations and Dependencies File.

The different experiments that have been carried out using DPDK sample applications and it's relevent implementation steps have been provided as "Bash" commands to be executed on the terminal in the folder "Procedure for implementation".

While setting up and using DPDK and DPDK Based Traffic Generators like Pktgen and Moongen , I encountered many errors which have been documented with their respective corrections in the "Errors and Resolutions" folder.
